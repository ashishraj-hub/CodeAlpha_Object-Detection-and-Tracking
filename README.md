# 📦 CodeAlpha Object Detection and Tracking

## 📌 Overview
This project demonstrates **real-time object detection and tracking** using the **YOLOv8 model**. It leverages deep learning to identify and track multiple objects in video streams or images, making it useful for applications in surveillance, autonomous systems, and computer vision research.

---

## 🚀 Features
- 🔍 **Object Detection** using YOLOv8 pretrained weights (`yolov8n.pt`)
- 🎥 **Real-time Tracking** of detected objects
- 📊 **Bounding Boxes & Labels** displayed on frames
- ⚡ Optimized for speed and accuracy
- 🛠️ Easy to extend for custom datasets
